#Rock Paper Scissor Generator

# For this project, you and your partner(s) will work to create a program that has a "player" and a "computer" adversary.
# The computer should randomly choose its decision based on a list of actions it can take ("Rock", "Paper" or "Scissors"). 
# The player should then have a chance to input their decision.
